Hey, long time no see!

It's late to update my schedule to manage it regularly.

That's because there are lots of things I tried and you know, I'm too lazy.

But I have something to write on during a vacation of github.

1. In Scholarship working, I learned a lot with Python.

  - Now I have a little experience of using numpy.
  - And learned how to use Pandas. -> "dataframe"
  /// these are for analyzing some data, especially from table.
  
  - Also, I learned how to crawling from hompages using API of those. -> "request.get" (with header and param)
      -> It's very useful to analyze public data. It would be interesting work if I get some benefit from that.
  
  - Finally, I learned how to manage database. Not only using a cmd window and command for that, but with Python(using pymusql.cursor) 
  
  // As reminding I've learned in Scholarship working(omnisense), I think above sequence is well arranged for learning.
  // I mean before I manage database in python, I have to know how to manage in cmd window and how to get those data.
  // For gethering data, I have to know crawling. And for that, I also need to know using dataframe in pandas.(numpy is some additional one.)

2. Learning front-end.
 - Basically, I learned html. It was pretty simple for itself.
 - And learned CSS. It is a little hard for using the commands wisely.
  -> Arranging, knowing properties of those command, etc.
 - As practicing css and html, I made a homepage which I tried to make it be similar to Nexon game homepage. The result is pretty good.

 // Now I'm gonna learn javascript.

3. Learning Data Analyzing from DSchool_AI_Summer_School
  - Data analyzing using Excel (simple analysis)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn(sns) with matplotlib
  - Make label(result) model using sklearn
  - I've learned how to use markdown and other function in jupyter notebook and handling dataframe
  // If have some time before or after army, I'll try data analysis. It's pretty fun and useful.
  
4. Challenging argorithm competition.
 - I tried ICPC and SCPC.
 - In ICPC, I tried to solve problems that I chose with my friends but, I couldn't. Actually, I couldn't solve any problems that I chose.
 - So embarrasing not to solve anything but, I think there should be some particular algorithm to solve those problems 
   because whenever I tried to finish, there are time issues or memory issues.
 - In SCPC, I only solved just one problem. And it happened like above one for rest of problems.

 // I've really felt that I need to try to solve and handle many algorithm problems.
 
5. English
 - I've not 'study' for a while because of failing of ICPC I think.
 - But, watching Bigbang Theory from nexflix, Now I feel my english skill grew up than I thought.
 - I think that's because I'm exposed to English a lot, which would be best way to learn English I think.
 - But those are also because I've spent time for watching some dramas, and then there's no time to study programming or somthing .
 - So, from now, I'm gonna split my time of a day. -> I'll post on later additionaly.
 - And I'm gonna add time to acually study english term and sentences as well as watching dramas for exposing me to english situation.
