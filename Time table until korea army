I'm going to korea army on 9/21 and there are some time to hang out with friends.

So I might not keep this time table but, I'm gonna try to keep in mind and do it.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

at least 3 hours for English (might 1~2 hours for 'stduying')

1~2 hours for exercise

3~4 hours for programming(one day for javascript, other day for solving algorithm, ... .)

0~2 hours for other hobby ( I'm gonna usually try to learn painting with Ipad.)

-> 3+2+4+2 = 11 hours. and there is time for have some food. so almost 12 hours.

-> but if I wake up early at 7:00 am, then there are extratime and I'll use that for adding time for daily tasks.
